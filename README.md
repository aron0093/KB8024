Part of the Master's course in Molecular Techniques in Life Science at Stockholm University

##OBJECTIVE: 
 Develop a SVM predictor for that predicts, signal peptide, transmembrane and globular regions.
##METHODOLOGY:
•	Data parsing and feature extraction. Include multiple window size functionality.
•	Creating SVM architecture using scikit-learn and choosing initial parameters.
•	Train and score SVM using cross validation for single sequence data per sequence.
•	Optimize performance by modifying parameters.
•	Extract evolutionary relationships using PSI-BLAST and modify features.
•	Train and score SVM using cross validation for multiple sequence per sequence.
•	Optimize performance by modifying parameters.
•	Extract the data from 50 other proteins and test the predictor.
•	Analyse the results, compare previous results and also with the state of the art.
•	Analyse performance compared to other ML methods.
